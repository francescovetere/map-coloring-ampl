# map-coloring-ampl

An implementation in [AMPL language](https://ampl.com/) of the *Map Coloring* problem (with an interesting variant).

In order to have a general idea on both the problem and its solution, you can check this [document](https://github.com/francescovetere/map-coloring-ampl/blob/master/relazione.pdf).

## Prerequisites
AMPL package is required (see [here](https://ampl.com/try-ampl/download-a-free-demo/)).
Once downloaded, just put your "/ampl" folder in the root folder of this project.

## Usage
Open a terminal in the root folder of this project, and type the following commands:
```
$ cd src
$ ../ampl/ampl
ampl: include map_coloring.run
```

You can also try to ```include map_coloring_2.run``` as well.
