# map-coloring-ampl

This is an implementation of the "Map Coloring" problem I made in [AMPL](https://ampl.com/)  language for the course "Ricerca Operativa" of my Master's Degree in "Computer Engineering - Internet Oriented Systems" at UniPR.

Please see the [paper](https://github.com/francescovetere/map-coloring-ampl/blob/master/relazione.pdf) I wrote about the project, in order to have a better understanding of the problem and of its solution.
