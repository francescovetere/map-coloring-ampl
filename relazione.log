I've put in what seems to be necessary to fix
the current column of the current alignment.
Try to go on, since this might almost work.

I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.

I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
or \cr or \span just now. If something like a right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

! Extra }, or forgotten \endgroup.
\endaligned ...cr \egroup \restorecolumn@ \egroup 
                                                  
l.213 \end{aligned}
                   
I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.
